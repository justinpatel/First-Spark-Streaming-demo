# First-Spark-Streaming-demo
This is the simulation of spark streaming in my local linux os pyspark jupyter notebook

Download the sales_log zip folder from [here](https://github.com/bsullins/bensullins.com-freebies/tree/f74eb037ba4284596f3879aa804c9e4ebca00716) which contains many csv files.

Assign path accordingly in the notebook.

The only difference in coding of streaming is that we add stream in the func name such as readStream instead of read, writeStream instead write.

Had fun learning and doing this hands-on.
